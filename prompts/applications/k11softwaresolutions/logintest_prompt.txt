Generate a complete, runnable Python pytest test function using Playwright for Python.
Test file: {filename}
MUST include:
- All required imports (pytest, playwright.sync_api, etc).
- Use the pytest-playwright page fixture for browser context and page management.
- A test function that:
  - Reads weburl, username, and password from a config or fixture (use placeholders if not specified).
  - Navigates to the weburl.
  - Fills the username and password fields and clicks the login button (use generic selectors if not specified).
  - Asserts that the dashboard is visible after login (e.g., page.is_visible('text=Dashboard')).
- Output ONLY Python code, no markdown.
- The code must be complete and not truncated.
