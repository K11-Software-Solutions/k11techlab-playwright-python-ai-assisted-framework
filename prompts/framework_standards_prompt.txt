# Playwright Framework Standards Prompt (Python)

- All Playwright test files should use pytest for test discovery and execution.
- Use fixtures for browser, context, and page setup/teardown (e.g., `@pytest.fixture`).
- Do not instantiate Playwright, browser, or page directly in test functions; use fixtures provided by pytest-playwright or your own conftest.py.
- Example test method:

  def test_example(page):
      # test steps using the provided Playwright page fixture
      page.goto("https://example.com")
      assert page.title() == "Example Domain"

- Use the Page Object Model for all page interactions. Each page should be a class in the `pages/` directory.
- Page object methods should encapsulate actions and assertions for that page.
- Follow Python best practices for naming, structure, and code style (PEP8).
- All test code should be readable, maintainable, and DRY.
